**Note**: All implementations should follow VoltAgent core patterns, use Zod schemas for validation, include comprehensive TSDoc documentation, and maintain strict TypeScript compliance.

```ts
// Example using streamText for a chat-like interaction
async function chat(input: string) {
  console.log(`User: ${input}`);
  // Use streamText for interactive responses
  const stream = await agent.streamText(input);

  for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
    console.log(chunk);
  }
}
```
